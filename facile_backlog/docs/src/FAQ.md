Why this FAQ it so empty?
-------------------------

Good question, it is probably a lack of time...


Why there is no way to manage iterations in your tool?
------------------------------------------------------

The goal of backlogman is not to provide such kind of functionality, we are convinced that iteration management should be
	managed on a physical board, it is why we propose printing through PDF generation.


I found a bug, how can I report it?
-----------------------------------

Issues can be filled directly in the [github repository](https://github.com/dsaradini/facile_backlog)


I want to run my own instance of the tool, is it possible?
