Backlogman FAQ
==============

### What is the lifecycle of a user story?

Stories are always tied to its original project, but can be associated to non project backlogs.
This is the case when a stories is panned in an organization's sprint backlog.

### When I archive a backlog, where the stories go?

Stories archived in an organization backlog can be seen in the project "all stories" views with "view archived" checkbox selected.
Keep in mind that stories are always tied to a project.


### Can I move back a story to its original project?

Yes, when bringing back a story from an organization backlog, the system will place the story at the top of
the main project backlog, if any.

### Why there is no way to manage sprints tasks in your tool?

The goal of backlogman is not to provide such kind of functionality, we are convinced that sprint management should be
	managed on a physical board, it is why we propose printing through PDF generation.

You can also use the project's boards tool to manage your tasks in a sprint


### A project is marked as "guest" in my dashboard, what's that?

A "guest" project is a project that is part of an organisation you do not have access too.
It is a way for companies to invite external customers to participate in a project without giving access to the organisation itself.
